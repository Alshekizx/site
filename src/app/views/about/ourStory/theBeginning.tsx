                        Humanness began with a simple yet profound realization: the power of community and compassion to transform lives. Founded in 2021, Humanness was born out of the desire to address two pressing challenges—providing sustainable meals to the homeless and empowering individuals to give back meaningfully.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-100">
                        Inspired by the struggles of underserved communities in Africa, our founder envisioned a unique approach—merging creativity, fashion, and philanthropy. What started as a small idea grew into a bold initiative to sell branded apparel and use the proceeds to fund feeding programs.

                    <p className="text-gray-100">
                        From humble beginnings, Humanness has reached key milestones, making a tangible difference in the lives of many. Join us on this journey as we continue to pursue our vision of a world where every individual thrives.
